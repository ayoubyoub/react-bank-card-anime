## React Bank cards annimation

This project uses 'react-spring' and 'react-gesture' libraries and is an extension of an example from the 'react-gesture' page. It is a re-imagined concept of swiping at tinder cards.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ayoubyoub/react-bank-card-anime.git
cd react-bank-card-anime
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

To add a new card, simply change the `data` file and populate the array with a new object.
Be sure to provide an image url for the `pics` key and fill the `name`, `age`, `distance` and `text` keys as well.
